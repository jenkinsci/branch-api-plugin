<div>
    Allows you to control which branches should be built automatically and which could be only scheduled manually.
    Two configuration options are available - allowed branches regular expression and suppression strategy.
    The used algorithm works as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>all branches which names don't match the regular expression are suppressed</li>
        <li>
            when a branch name matches the regular expression, the suppression strategy is checked to determine
            whether the trigger should be suppressed or not
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
