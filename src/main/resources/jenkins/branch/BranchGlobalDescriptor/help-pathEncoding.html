    Choose how branch names are encoded on disk:
    <ul>
        <li>Default: The legacy encoding, using URL encoding. Note that this may cause problems in some projects, as special characters are encoded with '%', which may have special meanings (eg. in Makefiles).</li>
        <li>Base64: The branch name is Base64 encoded. This is always safe, but the directory name is not human readable.</li>
        <li>Strip: A variant of URL encoding, with special characters replaced with underscores.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Warning: Changing this value will require projects that utilize the Branch API to be reindexed, eg. Multibranch Project & Multibranch Pipeline projects. This will cause history to be lost if the encoded branch name changes.</strong>
