blurb.BRANCH_NAME=For a multibranch project, this will be set to the name of the branch being built, for example in case you wish to deploy to production from <code>master</code> but not from feature branches; if corresponding to some kind of change request, the name is generally arbitrary (refer to <code>CHANGE_ID</code> and <code>CHANGE_TARGET</code>).
blurb.BRANCH_IS_PRIMARY=For a multibranch project, if the SCM source reports that the branch being built is a primary branch, this will be set to <code>"true"</code>; else unset. Some SCM sources may report more than one branch as a primary branch while others may not supply this information. 
blurb.CHANGE_ID=For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the change ID, such as a pull request number, if supported; else unset.
blurb.CHANGE_URL=For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the change URL, if supported; else unset.
blurb.CHANGE_TITLE=For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the title of the change, if supported; else unset.
blurb.CHANGE_AUTHOR=For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the username of the author of the proposed change, if supported; else unset.

blurb.CHANGE_BRANCH=For a multibranch project corresponding to some kind of change request, this will be set to the name of the actual head on the source control system which may or may not be different from <code>BRANCH_NAME</code>. For example in GitHub or Bitbucket this would have the name of the origin branch whereas <code>BRANCH_NAME</code> would be something like <code>PR-24</code>.
