## 2.4.0

Released: 2019-04-08

-   [JENKINS-56903](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-56903) -
    Add a health reporting metric for multibranch projects that only reports the health of the "primary" branch (as
    reported by the SCM)
-   [JENKINS-56917](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-56917) -
    Adds an extension point for organization folders that enabled the customization of the children of the organization
    folder on every organization folder scan. There are three implementations provided:
    -   Child Health metrics which allows controlling the health metrics
        that the child multibranch projects will use. Previous behaviour
        was to always configure just the default health metrics relevant
        to a multi-branch project.
    -   Child Scan Triggers which enabled the customization of the scan
        triggers for the child multibranch projects. Previous behaviour
        was to initially configure this to once per day and never update
        it. The new behaviour will now enforce the triggers defined
        in Child Scan Triggers for the organization folder.   
        > **NOTE** if you have been using some custom
        hack to change the multibranch scan triggers after initial
        creation, that hack is no longer needed... and in fact it will
        now cease to work
    -   Child Orphaned Item Strategy which allows the child multibranch
        projects to have a different orphaned item strategy from the
        parent organization folder. By default this property will use
        the *Inherited* strategy which retains the existing behaviour
        but you can configure a different strategy if you want branches
        to be retained on a different schedule from repositories.
-   Jenkins core version bump to 2.138 LTS line

## 2.3.0

Released: 2019-04-04

-   Set the revision even if the build does not happen. Enabling  
    [JENKINS-38552](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-38552) -
-   Migrated Chinese localization into localization-zh-cn
-   Updated some test dependencies

## 2.2.0

Released: 2019-03-21

-   [JENKINS-56658](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-56658) -
    Changed API for BranchBuildStrategy to provide strategies with access to the task listener. Impact assessment:
    -   Change is binary compatible. At run-time plugins implementing
        the older API will be transparently detected and the legacy API
        methods invoked as appropriate. 
    -   Change is not source compatible. Plugins implementing
        BranchBuildStrategy will need to update the overridden method
        when they update their compile time dependency on branch-api to
        2.2.0
-   [JENKINS-54968](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-54968) -

## 1.11.1

Released: 2016-11-04

-   [JENKINS-39520](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-39520)
    Error when dynamically installing multiple branch source plugins.

## 1.11

Released: 2016-09-23

-   [JENKINS-34564](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-34564)
    Branch projects now get custom workspace paths inside the node’s
    `workspace` directory, capped by default at 80 characters and using
    only ASCII letters, numbers, and simple punctuation (in particular,
    no `%`).
-   [JENKINS-37219](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-37219)
    Added a job property for overriding the implicit branch indexing
    trigger flag, allowing a multibranch `Jenkinsfile` to customize its
    own triggering behavior after the initial build.

Some projects running external processes that cannot handle even
moderately long pathnames will not work with the new default workspace
locations. The system property
`jenkins.branch.WorkspaceLocatorImpl.PATH_MAX` may be set to `0` to
restore the previous behavior (which will then break some processes
which cannot handle funny characters, or projects using long branch
names etc.). The default value is 80; values as low as 54 (but no lower)
are possible. When feasible, fix the external process to be more robust,
or on Windows use

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
\\?\
```

as a prefix before the remote filesystem root.

Another workaround in Pipeline scripts is to use the `ws` step with an
absolute pathname. You can then choose any path, and concurrent builds
will still get distinct workspaces automatically; but you are on the
hook for finding a *valid* path on the node, unrelated projects might
overwrite each other’s workspaces between builds (reducing beneficial
caches of SCM checkouts and the like), and the custom workspaces will
not be automatically deleted if the branch project is deleted. The first
problem could be avoided by using a pathname like `../custom` rather
than an absolute path.

Note that the `sshagent` Pipeline step ([SSH Agent
Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/SSH+Agent+Plugin)) when
used inside an `Image.inside` block ([Docker Pipeline
Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Docker+Pipeline+Plugin))
will not currently work when the workspace path exceeds 108 characters,
due to a poor choice of constant in most Linux kernels:
[JENKINS-36997](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36997).

A full fix should probably come in
[JENKINS-2111](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-2111) for
all project types.
